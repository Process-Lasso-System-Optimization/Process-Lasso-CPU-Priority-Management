## What is Process Lasso?

**Process Lasso** is a sophisticated and lightweight system utility developed by Bitsum Technologies to enhance the performance and stability of Windows-based computers. It operates by intelligently managing running processes, CPU core allocation, and system power plans to deliver a consistently responsive user experience‚Äîeven during intensive workloads.

Unlike traditional task managers, Process Lasso uses proprietary technologies such as **ProBalance** to prevent a single process from overconsuming system resources and causing freezes or lag. This makes it an invaluable tool for gamers, content creators, developers, and everyday users who demand reliability and speed from their systems.

Process Lasso runs seamlessly in the background, requiring minimal user interaction while providing maximum benefits. It is trusted by millions of users worldwide and is regularly updated to support the latest versions of Windows and modern hardware architectures.
